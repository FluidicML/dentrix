	Our preferred `Manufacturer` name is "Fluidic ML, INC." but the trailing
	period is stripped in certain contexts and not others. Don't include for
	consistency sake.
	
	As a concrete example, consider what would happen if we *did* specify
	`Manufacturer="Fluidic ML, INC."`. We use this manufacturer value as
	an intermediate installation folder. Depending on the filesystem though,
	folder names aren't allowed to end with trailing periods. The directory
	actually created on disk may have the period stripped, yielding e.g.:
	`C:\Program Files\Fluidic ML, INC`.
	
	But we also use the manufacturer value in the registry to tell our
	application where to look for certain files. The registry value would
	then be something like: `C:\Program Files\Fluidic ML, INC.`. This is a
	problem though - this latter path doesn't actually exist.

		This particular action exists for demonstration purposes. To write the value of a property
		into the installation script for use during a deferred execution custom action requires
		two steps:
		
		1. Insert a small custom action into the installation sequence that sets the property of
		   interest to a property having the same name as the deferred execution custom action. For
		   example, if the primary key for the deferred execution custom action is "MyAction" set
		   a property named "MyAction" to the property X which you need to retrieve. You must set
		   the "MyAction" property in the installation sequence before the "MyAction" custom action.
		   Although any type of custom action can set the context data, the simplest method is to
		   use a property assignment custom action (for example Custom Action Type 51).
		
		2. At the time when the installation sequence is processed, the installer will write the
		   value of property X into the execution script as the value of the property CustomActionData.
